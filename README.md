# Obect Detection with OpenCV

This capstone project is a key component of the "Tracking and Detection in Computer Vision" course at TU-Munich, led by Dr. Slobodan Ilic. It offers a focused exploration into practical and theoretical aspects of computer vision, emphasizing object detection using Random Forests.

## Task 1: Image Processing and HOG Descriptor

We start with OpenCV for C++, learning about basic image processing and extracting Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors from images using the built-in HOGDescriptor class.

## Task 2: Object Classification

Next, we implement object classification using Binary Decision Trees and Random Forests with OpenCV’s cv::ml::DTrees class. We create, train, and predict classes, and then extend this knowledge to develop a Random Forest class, learning the ‘create’, ‘train’, and ‘predict’ methods.

## Task 3: Object Detection

We apply Random Forests for object detection, utilizing a dataset of diverse objects and backgrounds. We augment the dataset to enhance model training and achieve precise object detection.

> By the end of the course, participants will have hands-on experience and a deep understanding of object detection using Random Forests, ready for advanced studies and practical applications in computer vision.
